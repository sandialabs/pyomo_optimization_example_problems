# Example Problems

## hypersensitive_problem
The adaptive mesh scheme is demonstrated on a published hypersensitive optimal control problem.

## planar_problem_multiphase
Move from (x,y) = (0 m, 0 m) to (4.0 m, 8.0 m), while avoiding an obstacle and passing through (3.5 m, 2.5 m).

## control_sys_optimization
Flexibility of the object-oriented structure is demonsrated on a textbook control system gain optimization problem. Stability margin constraints are included.

## Software used to devise these problems:
* Python 3.7.1 
* Pyomo 5.6.1 
* Ipopt 3.12.4
